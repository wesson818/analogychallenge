# analogychallenge (Analogy Master)

It's always good to have time to learn something new, and even better to use what you learned to work on a real personal project.

Here is Analogy Master - a progressive web application using React, and then converted to mobile app using React Native, to help my son and his schoolmates prepare for the verbal reasoning of assessment and entrance exams. My son also contributed to the app design and workflow. Proud of him!
